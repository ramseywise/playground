# _facts_callbacks.py
# Expert-agent callbacks for the fact lifecycle.
#
#   inject_facts_callback           — before_model_callback on all expert agents.
#                                     Reads public:session_facts, handles early persistence
#                                     (persist_now=True), and appends a "[session facts: {...}]"
#                                     user text message after the last real user message so
#                                     the LLM always sees the current facts.  The system
#                                     instruction is NOT modified — keeping it stable for
#                                     prefix caching.  No invocation guard needed —
#                                     strip_tool_history_callback removes prior injections.
#
#   persist_facts_callback          — after_agent_callback on all expert agents.
#                                     Moves 'draft' facts from public:session_facts
#                                     into public:fact_history and marks them 'persisted'.
#
#   router_force_context_callback   — after_model_callback on the router agent.
#                                     Intercepts direct transfer_to_agent responses that
#                                     bypassed get_conversation_context, replacing them
#                                     with a get_conversation_context call so the tool is
#                                     always executed before routing.
