# callbacks.py
# Router-level callbacks. Provides two LLM-bypass fast paths:
#
#   follow_up_shortcut   — saves one LLM call per follow-up turn by detecting
#                          obvious answer messages (bare IDs, yes/no, short
#                          non-command fragments) and routing directly.
#
#   static_route_shortcut — saves one LLM call for high-confidence single-domain
#                           messages by keyword scoring (routing.py). Falls through
#                           to the LLM when confidence is low or multi-domain.
#                           A re-route guard (_STATIC_BYPASS_KEY) prevents a loop
#                           if an expert escape-hatches back through the router.
#
# router_before_model_callback chains both shortcuts: follow-up first, then static.
#
# receptionist_before_model_callback — intercepts out-of-scope requests (expense,
#   payroll, etc.) before the LLM runs, returning a consistent decline message.
