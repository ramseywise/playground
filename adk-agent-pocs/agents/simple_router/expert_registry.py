# expert_registry.py
# Single source of truth for domain experts.
#
# To add a new expert (e.g. expense_agent):
#   1. Create tools/expense_tools.py          — domain-specific tools
#   2. Create prompts/expense_agent.txt        — agent prompt
#   3. Create sub_agents/expense_agent.py      — call register(Agent(...)) (no assignments needed)
#   4. Import it in sub_agents/__init__.py     BEFORE orchestrator_agent
#   5. Add it to the sub_agents list in agent.py
#   6. Add a routing rule for it in prompts/router_agent.txt
#   7. Add its routing patterns to prompts/receptionist_agent.txt
#
# What wires itself automatically after steps 1–4:
#   — helper variant (name, prompt suffix, include_contents, output_key)
#   — orchestrator tool list ({domains} injection picks up the new expert's description)
# Steps 5–7 still require manual edits to agent.py, router_agent.txt, and receptionist_agent.txt.
