# routing.py
# Deterministic scored router. No LLM call.
# Returns a RoutingDecision so callers and observability tools can inspect the decision.
#
# Scoring terms per expert are declared in expert_registry.ExpertSpec.routing_terms.
# Adding a new expert automatically extends the router — no changes needed here.
