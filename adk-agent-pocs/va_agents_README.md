### Page Context Awareness
When the assistant is embedded in Billy, it reads the current URL and gives more relevant responses automatically — no extra input needed.

### Suggested Follow-ups
After every response, the assistant suggests 2–4 contextual next actions as clickable chips.

|---|---|
| After listing invoices | "Create a new invoice", "Show invoice summary" |

### Support Knowledge Fallback
When a request is outside the assistant's direct tools (e.g., bank reconciliation, VAT, reports), it searches the Billy support documentation and walks you through it step by step, with source links and navigation buttons.

### Contact Support Escalation
The assistant automatically shows a **Contact Customer Service** button when:
- It cannot help after multiple attempts
- The user expresses frustration (e.g. `"this is not working"`, `"you're useless"`)
- The same question is asked 3+ times without resolution
- The user asks to speak to a human (e.g. `"I want to talk to someone"`)
